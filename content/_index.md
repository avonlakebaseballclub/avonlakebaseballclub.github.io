# Your support matters
We believe that every talented, young baseball player, regardless to economic background, should have an equal
opportunity to play competitive baseball. Travel baseball will cost each family **a minium $500 per year and per player**. Fundraising can help lessen the burden.

## Where do you your donations go?
Your donations go to fund youth travel baseball teams in Avon Lake, OH. These donations are used for the following:
- buy gear, like bats, mitts, catcher's equipment, batting helmets, etc.
- pay for time in practice facilities
